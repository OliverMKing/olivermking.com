Welcome to my blog! I'm starting this to document things that I find interesting and want to share. There will be a particular emphasis on Computer Science and Software Engineering topics, though.

Starting with Hello World is a bit corny but appropriate since this is my first time using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'm looking forward to taking advantage of the simplicity of a simple static site generator.
