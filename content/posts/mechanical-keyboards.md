A few years ago I began my mechanical keyboard journey. I was unsatisfied with the membrane keyboard serving as my daily driver. As a college student and Software Engineer, my future was clearly filled with an exorbitant amount of typing and I knew there were higher-quality tools available. It turns out that my friends had similar realizations and I quickly learned of the highly coveted mechanical keyboard. Five keyboards and a few years later, I finally have a true grasp on navigating the mechanical keyboard scene.

## Benefits of a Mechanical Keyboard

Mechanical keyboard's largest benefit is simply providing a more satisfying typing experience than other kinds. They feel good to type on. There's also typing performance (speed and accuracy) benefits and increased keyboard durability.

## Prebuilt vs Custom Keyboard

The first big decision you have to make is whether you want to build your own custom board or buy a prebuilt one.

Advantages of Custom

- Every aspect is customizable (many options aren't available for prebuilts)
- Higher quality
- Unique and a one of a kind
- Fun to build and learn

Advantages of Prebuilt

- It's cheaper (potentially significantly)
- Don't have to assemble yourself
- Less decisions
- Easier
- Faster (custom boards often have to wait for parts)

To make this decision a little easier, I should explain exactly what is required for building a custom board. We will go over what these terms mean later but keep in mind that if you are serious about building a custom board you will need to research them as well.

Needed parts

- Keyboard case
- Keyboard plate
- Keyboard PCB
- Keyboard cable
- Switches
- Stabilizers
- Keycaps
- Screws

Needed tools

- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Screwdriver

After acquiring these parts you have to put it together which is essentially just screwing things together and soldering. The soldering part isn't that challenging. Building a keyboard was my first time soldering, which was pretty daunting, but the actual process is straightforward after a few tutorials. I wouldn't let fear of soldering be the barrier to a custom build if that's what is holding you back.

Knowing exactly which options are actually available for each might also help you make your decision.

## Prebuilts

As the name implies, prebuilts are mechanical keyboards that come completely assembled (with a few minor exceptions). They are strong options for people that want a great typing experience but aren't interested in fully assembling the board themselves. There's still tons of options and decisions to make, though.

## Keyboard Parts

## Switches

Switches are the part of the keyboard that impact feel the most. They are the mechanism that detects key presses and make the key travel up and down. There's three main categories of switches to help you further simplify your decision.

### Tactical

Tactical switches have a bump at the actuation point providing tactical feedback to your fingers. This bump comes in many shapes and sizes changing the resulting feel significantly.

### Clicky

### Linear

### Further Decisions

Further decisions are difficult if you haven't felt a switch yourself. Even feeling a single one versus typing is a different experience.
