A few years ago I began my mechanical keyboard journey. I was unsatisfied with the membrane keyboard serving as my daily driver. As a college student and Software Engineer, my future was clearly filled with an exorbitant amount of typing and I knew there were higher-quality tools available. It turns out that my friends had similar realizations and I quickly learned of the highly coveted mechanical keyboard. Six keyboards, few years later, and more money than I'm willing to admit I finally have a true grasp on navigating the mechanical keyboard scene.

## Benefits of a Mechanical Keyboard

Mechanical keyboard's largest benefit is simply providing a more satisfying typing experience than other kinds. They feel good to type on. There's also typing performance (speed and accuracy) benefits and increased keyboard durability.

## Prebuilt vs Custom Keyboard

The first big decision you have to make is whether you want to build your own custom board or buy a prebuilt one.

Advantages of Custom

- Every aspect is customizable (many options aren't available for prebuilts)
- Higher quality
- Unique and a one of a kind
- Fun to build and learn

Advantages of Prebuilt

- It's cheaper (potentially significantly)
- Don't have to assemble yourself
- Less decisions
- Easier
- Faster (custom boards often have to wait for parts)

To make this decision a little easier, I should explain exactly what is required for building a custom board. We will go over what these terms mean later but keep in mind that if you are serious about building a custom board you will need to research them as well.

Needed parts

- Keyboard case
- Keyboard plate
- Keyboard PCB
- Keyboard cable
- Switches
- Stabilizers
- Keycaps
- Screws

Needed tools

- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Screwdriver

After acquiring these parts you have to put it together which is essentially just screwing things together and soldering. The soldering part isn't that challenging. Building a keyboard was my first time soldering, which was pretty daunting, but the actual process is straightforward after a few tutorials. I wouldn't let fear of soldering be the barrier to a custom build if that's what is holding you back.

Knowing exactly which options are actually available for each might also help you make your decision.

## Prebuilts

As the name implies, prebuilts are mechanical keyboards that come completely assembled (with a few minor exceptions). They are strong options for people that want a great typing experience but aren't interested in fully assembling the board themselves. There's still tons of options and decisions to make, though.

## Keyboard Parts

### Switches

Switches are the part of the keyboard that impact feel the most. They are the mechanism that detects key presses and make the key travel up and down. Switch choice comes entirely down to personal preference. There's three main categories of switches to help you further simplify your decision.

#### Tactical

Tactical switches have a bump at the actuation point providing tactical feedback to your fingers. This bump comes in many shapes and sizes changing the resulting feel significantly.

These are my favorite kinda of switches. I find the bump extremely satisfying to type on. Boba U4 and U4Ts are what I use on my boards but I'd also recommend looking into Holy Panda Xs, Zealios V2s, and T1s. Topre switches are close to U4T's feel but are only available on a few prebuilt builds.

#### Clicky

Clicky switches have a similar feel to Tactical switches but they emit a significantly louder noise that's often high pitched. The amount of noise clicky switches generate make me hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

#### Linear

Linear switches are an extremely smooth switch that feel like they are going straight down then back up. There's no physical feedback from the switch and it is a consistent feeling.

Linear switches that I've liked include Alpaca V2s, Vintage MX Blacks, and Bobagums but there's many notable ones I haven't tried.

#### Further Decisions

If you have decided on a prebuilt, the options you have for switches are already limited (unless the board is hotswap). Prebuilts only have a few switch options helping you limit the amount of decisions. If that doesn't apply, further decisions are difficult if you haven't consumed a switch yourself. Even feeling a single one versus typing is a different experience. There's a common belief that some switches are better for different activities than others (e.g. linear switches are better for video games) but I wouldn't let them sway your decisions. Linears are better in a situation where you absolutely need as many presses as possible but the real-world performance of the two is close enough where it having any actual impact is highly unlikely.

It's important to note that linear and tactile switches also have silent switch options. While not completely silent they attempt to dampen noise as much as possible. Some people enjoy the "thocking" noise switches make while others find it annoying.

[ThereminGoat.com](https://www.theremingoat.com/) is a good way to research switches and get an in-depth review. His [switch scores list](https://github.com/ThereminGoat/switch-scores/blob/master/1-Composite%20Hard%20Total%20Score%20Sheet.csv) is a good way to get started.

### Stabilizers

Going hand-in-hand with switches are stabilizers. Stabilizers keep your larger keys stable by supporting them along the sides. The spacebar is the best visualizer of this. Without stabilizers, it would only be supported by a single switch in the center creating a vastly varying sensation depending on where on the key you press.

Popular "stabs" come in screw-in and clip-in types. Both connect to the PCB like the name suggests. Screw-in are my personal preference since it is impossible for the stabilizer to fall out in screw-in but apparently there are some new clip-in stabilizers that have revolutionized this part.

Don't skimp out on the stabilizers. Good stabilizers create a nice deep sound and feel for the board while cheap ones create a rattle and inconsistent experience. Durock V2 / Everglide V2, Zealios, Owl, and TX are my personal suggestions.

### Keycaps

Keycap choice obviously impacts board aesthetic but also changes texture and sound. Some keycaps are smooth while others have miniscule bumps on top. Personally, I haven't experienced a keycap texture I've disliked.

#### Profiles

Profile refers to the shape of a keycap which commonly varies in height and finger impression. Smaller tops mean key presses have to be more accurate while typing.

Cherry profile is the most common mechanical keyboard keycap profile and my personal favorite.

#### Brand

Brand impacts the material, durability, texture, and quality of the keycap. ABS and PBT plastics are the most common materials with slight tradeoffs between the two.

Legends on a keycap are either printed or double shot injected. Double shot uses two plastics making the legend effectively last forever. Higher-quality printing isn't prone to losing legends but they will eventually fade a bit.

GMK and ePBT are my favorite but they are luxury brands and more expensive.

### Case

The case is the outer part of the keyboard. It's commonly found in Aluminum, Acrylic, and more traditional plastics. It impacts feel, weight, and sound of the board.

Personally, I've found Acrylic to be the perfect medium between premium but not bank-breaking. Aluminum boards do feel nicer but if cost is an issue the acrylic boards are still great! My keyboards don't leave my desk so they don't need to be indestructible (acrylic and plastic are still very durable).

### Plate

The plate is a layer that sits on top of the PCB but under the top of the case. It helps hold the switches in and highly impacts sound. It commonly comes in brass and plastic. Again, one's not strictly better than the other and it comes down to preference. I've liked both but have found that metal plates are definitely better for me.

### Layout

For newcomers, it's often surprising how many different layout options keyboards have. More typical layouts are 60%, 65%, 75%, tenkeyless, 100%. The options for enthusiasts are almost endless with Alice, Split, Ortholinear, and other ergonomic layouts being popular. The reality is that with proper typing form, all these layouts should be comfortable.

You can narrow down desired layout based on your every day use and deskspace. If you don't use the numpad, cut them out. If you don't use the function keys, cut them out. In a similar vein, if you don't commonly use something you can consider putting it on another layer. Again, a proper touch-typist should be able to bake simple "layers" for a few keys into their muscle memory with little effort.

Alice is my favorite due to its ergonomic nature while not being so far from traditional layouts that I can't adjust as needed. Adapting to and from my work laptop keyboard is no problem. There's other, more extreme, ergonomic layouts including split and what can only be described as "hand shaped".

At the end of the day, layout is completely preference and typists can adjust to any popular layout.

## Buying

If you've decided on a pre-built or just want to browse, your path is fairly straightforward. I've had great experiences with [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/) and highly recommend them. Leopold, Ducky, and HHKB are my recommended brands for pre-built. The Ducky One 3 is hotswap if you are looking for more enthusiast-grade switches. The [Glorious GMMK Pro](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black) and [NovelKeys](https://novelkeys.com/) boards are other well-regarded hotswap pre-built. Hotswap means you can easily change the switches opening an almost endless slew of options.

Unfortunately, purchasing a custom mechanical keyboard isn't so easy. The demand for extremely high-quality custom boards limits large corporation's involvement with the custom scene. Custom boards are often produced by individuals through "group buys". Group buys have a period where customers can sign up then the board will be manufactured and shipped, likely taking months for the entire process.

Not only is this process inconvenient, but potential buyers also must properly vet sellers. These individual sellers often partner with reputable websites building rapport.
